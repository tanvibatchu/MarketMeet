The Correlation heatmap ensures diversification by revealing if stocks are redundant (moving identically) or independent.
It is normalized on a scale of -1 to +1. By removing volatility, it tells us if stocks move in sync.
If two stocks have a high correlation (close to 1), they are mathematically redundant. This information helps diversify a portfolio


The Covariance heatmap measures actual risk magnitude, identifying how volatile individual stocks are and how much they swing together.
It combines correlation plus volatility, which tells us how much actual risk is being generated.
A high covariance means two stocks not only move together but do so with violent swings
